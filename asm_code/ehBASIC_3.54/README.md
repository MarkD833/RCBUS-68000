 EhBASIC68

 Enhanced BASIC is a BASIC interpreter for the 68k family microprocessors. It  
 is constructed to be quick and powerful and easily ported between 68k systems.  
 It requires few resources to run and includes instructions to facilitate easy  
 low level handling of hardware devices. It also retains most of the powerful  
 high level instructions from similar BASICs.
