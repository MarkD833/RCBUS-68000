# RCBUS-68000-Boards

These folders contain the KiCad (v8) design files for the various RCBus 68000 boards I'm currently testing.

| Board Folder | Description |
| 68000_CPU_Board_PLCC | 68000 processor card using the PLCC package variant of the 68000 |
| 68000_ROM_RAM_Board | 128K ROM & 1M RAM board |
| 68000_SIO_Board | Dual MC68681 serial board - 4 serial ports |

Still to come are the dual 68230 PI/T board and the dual 68901 multifunction serial/parallel/timer board.

Make sure to look at the readme.txt files in each board folder as they will detail any errors and corrections I've noticed so far.
